    Stretch Questions

1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
    display: block means that the element is displayed as a block, as paragraphs and headers have always been. 
    A block has some whitespace above and below it and tolerates no HTML elements next to it, 
    except when ordered otherwise (by adding a float declaration to another element, for instance).

    display: inline means that the element is displayed inline, inside the current block on the same line. 
    Only when it's between two blocks does the element form an 'anonymous block', 
    that however has the smallest possible width.

    Yes i copy pasted this awnser, but the description was so good i felt it was wrong not to copy it.
2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
    absolute position makes a element use its closest parent to guide its location on a page,
    if it has no parent it will use the body.
3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 

4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
    display: block: <p><li><section><table><div>
    display: inline: <span><a><input><em>
    display: inline-block:<span> <nav>
5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model? 
    the box model is what most of a webpage is made from. webpages use a x,y pixel system so as you add content,
    it fills up a page. we modify content via 4 sides of content thus giving us a box.
